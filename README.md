## Use this to test your program:
* projectPOO.exe ./CommandsFiles/CreateTableCommand.txt ./CommandsFiles/SelectFromTableCommand.txt

* projectPOO.exe ./CommandsFiles/SelectFromTableCommand.txt

* projectPOO.exe ./CommandsFiles/MixedCommands.txt

* projectPOO.exe ./CommandsFiles/DisplayTableCommand.txt

* projectPOO.exe ./CommandsFiles/DropTableCommand.txt

* projectPOO.exe ./CommandsFiles/InsertIntoCommand.txt
